Title: Building a Dynamic Bar Chart with React and Recharts
Summary:
In this code, you learned how to create a dynamic bar chart using the Recharts library in React. Key takeaways include:

Fetching and Transforming Data:

Data is fetched using a marksPromise and processed with the use hook.
The data is transformed into a format suitable for charting, including calculating averages for each student.
Using Recharts Components:

Components like BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, Tooltip, and Legend are used to build a visually appealing chart.
Each bar represents a subject (Physics, Chemistry, Math) with distinct colors.
Dynamic Rendering:

The chart dynamically adapts to the provided data, making it reusable for different datasets.
React Best Practices:

Functional components and hooks (use) are used for state management and data handling.
The console.log statements help debug and verify data transformations.
